# cartpole-dqn
Implemented a Deep Q-Network in PyTorch to solve the CartPole environment, building the replay buffer, target-network updates, and epsilon-greedy exploration schedule from scratch. Monitored reward and loss curves with Matplotlib and tuned parameters such as discount factor and epsilon decay to improve training stability.
